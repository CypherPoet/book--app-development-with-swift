/*:
 ## Exercise - Extensions
 
 Define an extension to `Character` that includes a function `isVowel()`. The function returns `true` if the character is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u), and `false` otherwise. Be sure to properly handle uppercase and lowercase characters.
 */


/*:
 Create two `Character` constants, `myVowel` and `myConsonant`, and set them to a vowel and a consonant, respectively. Use the `isVowel()` methods on each constant to determine whether or not it's a vowel.
 */


/*:
 Create a `Rectangle` struct with two variable properties, `length` and `width`, both of type `Double`. Below the definition, write an extension to `Rectangle` that includes a function, `half()`. This function returns a new `Rectangle` instance with half the length and half the width of the original rectangle.
 */


/*:
 Within the existing `Rectangle` extensions, add a new mutating function, `halved()`, which updates the original rectangle to have half the length and half the width. Use the `half()` function as part of the implementation for `halved()`.
 */


/*:
 Create a variable `Rectangle` called `myRectangle`, and set its length to 10 and its width to 5. Create a second instance, `mySmallerRectangle`, that's the result of calling `half()` on `myRectangle`. Then update the values of `myRectangle` by calling `halved()` on itself. Print each of the instances.
